<h1>Unit 1, outcome 2 & 3:</h1>

<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
    E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

<p>I feel I have struggled on this task using Visual Studio Code. It has taken a few hours to even generate the most simple of tasks and it 
    has become frustrating after small slow progress was achieved. I feel that in hindsight, I would have studied this technology more in-depth 
    before jumping into creating a website and visually planned/designed the webpage. Trello on the other hand was very handy and helped ease the stress and the to do outcomes needed by 
    organising them well</p>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>

<p> The tools selected for this project were appropiate however their given explainations were not very strong which caused a lot of confusement.
    Visual Code is a good tool to use once youve had time to gain skills on it. When a beginner, I dont feel it is of great value. Its a little 
    complex and longwinded for beginners and expecting beginers to run with it instantly isnt really going to gain any positive results. 
</p>

<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the 
    website itself in the interest of openess. What would you change?</h2>

<p>Its hard to find any concrete stregnths other than being able to use gifs/videos as the web background. Other than that I feel my experience and my 
    final project website is a lot less of satisfactory than my hopes and expectations. I would change the teaching methods and the level of rushing 
    through course content to ensure all students dont just know but understand the logic and the functions. Being told what does what isnt helpful when 
    youre building a whole website that has hundreds of functions and mechanisms and coding.

</p>

<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>

<p>
    My project is in need of many improvements but i have developed what I can and feel it is of good standard for a complete beginner. If using this again to 
    go on to develop more websites, I would most likely spend a few weeks on understanding html and css in depth. Im not a fan of doing something that I dont have
    a good understanding of.
</p>

<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>

<p>
   I feel the outcomes will be of standard for the task given and i feel I have completed the required goals. 

    </p>

        <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making 
                your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
            
            <p>
                In terms of efficiency, I feel I have done a good level of progress in making my website under the given circumstances and time allocated which is very tight and strict. 
                I think given more time to work on the website, I would definately have achieved more and been more familiar and confident than I am currently on the technology and the 
                ability to build websites. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
            
            <p>
                I think more time and indepth expectations would have helped to gain a more concrete understanding to website development and the use of Trello and Visual Studio Code.
                i really think more time is needed for the teaching of the code and the css coding skills as they can be misleading and more difficult that they are made out to be. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
                    would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Once solution would be to hand draw and design the layout of the website before beginning the coding and design on visual code. I think this task would have been better if it was a group project as it was a lot to understand and develop in the very small amount of time we had. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
                </h2>
            
            <p>
               To text the developed digital solutions, the visual code of both html and css of each page to be organised and run on an open safari. This give the ability to view the webpage in realtime and see the outcome of the code and evaluate any needed changes.
