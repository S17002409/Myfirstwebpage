      <h1> Unit 2 Outcome 1 </h1>

      <h2>Create structures and styles for a webpage
      You are setting up as an independent consultant, which is very exciting, however, you’re going to need a website of your own to highlight your skills, availability and areas of work. It’s time for you to create a website that details you, and including pages/sections and a how you built it page:</h2>
      
      <p>
          To create this website I first developed a Trello board in order to organise my workload. I then read and learnt as much of html coding and css coding in order to begin my webpage. i first started with the basics such as background and text colours. I did struggle with many aspects of Visual conde not exactly doing what I needed it to so this did become fruastrating. However, I feel for a complete beginner that i did well and I managed to cover the tasks and develop the needed functions.

      <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>

      <p>The first page is the entrance page which is what the view will see initially. For this I found a gif image that was perfect for my research and also looked both inviting and proffesional. The 3 pages of questions were kept within the same format in order to have consistancy and a steady theme. I also developed a link that allows the viewer to access my Trello board for this project. The final page was developed as a contact me page to allow viewers to follow my company instagram and personal instagram account.</p>



      <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>

      <p>
            Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish.  The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.

      <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
     
      <p>Issues that may arise due to disabilities include, the first page includes flashing images which may affect those with epilepsy. Other issues may be that it oculd not be clear or straight forward enough for thise with learning difficulties.</p>
     

      <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>

      <p>
            As there are many different file formats to choose from, we have selected the four we think work best on the web: a JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF, all of which contain a lossy or lossless compression. A lossy compression means images lose information and quality once the file size decreases whereas a lossless compression does not lose any detail when the file size is changed.
      </p>

      <p>
            JPEG
            Joint Photographics Expert Group - otherwise known as a JPEG or JPG are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. They are also a good choice for saving images with complex colour and shading.
        </p>

        <p>
            PNG
            Depending on which PNG you use (either PNG-8 or PNG-24). the more colours you can include. PNG-8s are capable of containing a maximum of 256 colours whereas a PNG-24 can contain an unlimited amount of colours. This means they are not just suitable for images, but also graphics and text. PNGs also give you control over transparency, unlike JPEGs, which makes them pretty much perfect for logos. PNGs also use a lossless compression, meaning they don’t lose any information or quality.
            
            One of the main drawbacks of using PNGs, however, is that some web browsers do not support them. If your logo is saved as a PNG and someone is viewing your website on a browser that does not support them, it simply won’t appear.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gifs
            GIFs tend to be much smaller file sizes compared to other formats and aren’t capable of containing millions of colours. Just like PNGs, GIFs also support transparency, which would make them suitable for small graphics and logos, and due to their small file size, this format is great for placing lots of small graphics such as icons and buttons on the same page.
            The most interesting thing about GIFs is that they can be animated, meaning you can make moving images for your website such as an animated logo because they are raster based. Although the quality wouldn’t be amazing, you can also cut film clips and save them as a GIF to upload to your website.
        </p>

        <p>
            SVG
            SVGs are vector based formats, meaning they aren’t built using pixels like the other three formats we’ve looked at, instead they’re built using mathematical formulas. As SVGs are based on vectors, they aren’t the best choice when saving photographs, however, they are a good choice for drawings and line art.
            
            With SVGs, you can create full resolution images that will look good on any screen size, zoom level or resolution, which makes these great for graphics that can be viewed on all devices such as desktop, tablets and mobile phones.
            
            SVGs do not require any HTML requests and will, therefore, improve page speed.
